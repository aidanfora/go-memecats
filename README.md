# go-memecats

`go-memecats` is a project inspired by [vyrus001's go-mimikatz](https://github.com/vyrus001/go-mimikatz), which aims to replicate its functionalities while updating the codebase to utilise newer Go syntax.

### Features
- Replicates core functionalities of [mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz).
- Utilises AES encryption for better AV evasion.
- Works on **Windows 11**.
- Evades detection by Windows Defender AV as of 15 May 2024.

Note that extended use and suspicious activity will definitely still trigger anti-virus alerts!
